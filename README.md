# Simpler Things RPG Extras

Additional resources for the [Simpler Things RPG Engine](https://github.com/ekultails/simpler_things_rpg). Refences guides, character sheets, and examples are provided.

## Documents

### Character Sheet

The [stre_character_sheet.fods](stre_character_sheet.fods) character sheet is in the Flat OpenDocument Spreadsheet (FODS) document format.

Instructions on how to create a PDF:

- LibreOffice Calc
    - File > Print Preview > Format Page > Sheet > Print > (check the box for “Grid”) > OK
    - File > Export as PDF... > Export

### Player Character Guide

The [stre_pc_guide.md](stre_pc_guide.md) document is an introduction to TTRPG and how to use skills in the game.
