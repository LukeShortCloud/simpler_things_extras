# Simpler Things RPG Extras - Player Character Guide

## TTRPG Introduction

Table-top role-playing games (TTRPGs), in many ways, break the boundaries that board games and video games set. You are only limited by your imagination. You play as a living breathing being with your own thoughts and desires. Want an easy character? Make them as a reflection of yourself. Or branch off and develop them as uniquely as you'd like. Define your character any way you want! You make choices for what you want your character to do and roll dice to see if you succeed or not. An average TTRPG session takes 3 hours but could go shorter or longer.

## Skills Usage

Each skill can be used to perform an action in game. Pick skills to boost that align with your character and how you want to play.

Examples for how to use every skill:

- Convincing = Persuade an NPC, negotiate a good deal with a merchant, etc.
- Electronics = Hack into a terminal, fix a car, etc.
- Examination = Look for clues, look for hidden traps, etc.
- Fistfight = Punch or kick a character.
- Geography = Find out how to get from point A to B, determine the vegetation in the area, ride horses, drive cars, fly spaceships, etc.
- Healing = Heal yourself or others.
- Lore = See if you remember the history of a person/place/thing, know the latest street rumors, know what the locals think, etc.
- Sneak = Hide, sneak around a guard, etc.
- Strength = Push open a simple door, move a heavy container, etc.
- Stunts = Jump off of a roof, walk on a thin rope, etc.
- Weapons (near) = Fight with a melee weapon, try to break a lock, etc.
- Weapons (far) = Fight with a gun, shoot a target, etc.

## Character Creation

Use a [character sheet](https://github.com/ekultails/simpler_things_extras/raw/master/stre_character_sheet.fods) (right-click and select "Save link as...") or other document to write down information about your character as you create them. You and the game master will reference this sheet during gameplay.

### Species

Pick a species that either (1) interests you or (2) one that is better at skills you would like to use. Here are the base skills the species is good at when starting the game:

- `<SPECIES>` `(<TRAIT>)` = `<SKILL_1>`, `<SKILL_2>`, `<SKILL_3>`, and `<SKILL_4>`.
- Alien (Awareness) = Convincing, Examination, Sneak, and Weapons (far).
- Human (Vitality) = Fistfight, Strength, Stunts, and Weapons (near).
- Robot (Knowledge) = Electronics, Geography, Healing, and Lore.

### Skill Boost

Pick one skill to boost (increase your effectiveness in). This will allow you to roll more dice for that skill. The more dice you can roll, the more likely you are to succeed at the action you are trying to do.

Either (1) pick a skill that your species is not good at to become more well-rounded or (2) pick a skill that your species is good at to become even better at it. You will either start with (1) 5 skills you are good at or (2) 3 skills you are good at and 1 skill you are great at.

### Buy Items (Equipment)

You have $1000 to spend on armor and/or weapons. View the costs in the [Items section of the game rules](https://github.com/ekultails/simpler_things_rpg/blob/master/simpler_things.md#items). Any unspent money will be yours to keep.

### Calculate Health

First, determine your vitality stat based on the species you picked (see below). This will be the same for all new characters.

- Alien and Robot = 1
- Human = 2

Next, determine if any armor was bought. Finally, calculate your characters' current health:

Health = (Vitality x 20) + Armor

### Design Your Character

Figure out who your character is, their desires, and their backstory. For tips, refer to the [Life Pages TTRPGs Character Creation guide](https://github.com/ekultails/lifepages/blob/master/src/games/tabletop.rst#character-creation).

## Rules

Read over the [official rules for Simpler Things RPG](https://github.com/ekultails/simpler_things_rpg/blob/master/simpler_things.md) to get a better understanding of the game. As a player, you are not expected to memorize these rules. The game master will be in charge of knowing how the rules work.
