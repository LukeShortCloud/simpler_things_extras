# Simpler Things RPG Extras - Player Character Guide

## TTRPG Introduction

Table-top role-playing games (TTRPGs), in many ways, break the boundaries that board games and video games set. You are only limited by your imagination. You play as a living breathing being with your own thoughts and desires. Want an easy character? Make them as a reflection of yourself. Or branch off and develop them as uniquely as you'd like. Define your character any way you want! You make choices for what you want your character to do and roll dice to see if you succeed or not. An average TTRPG session takes 3 hours but could go shorter or longer.

## Skills Usage

Each skill can be used to perform an action in game. Pick skills to become an expert in that align with your character and how you want to play.

Examples for how to use every skill:

- Convincing = Persuade an NPC, negotiate a good deal with a merchant, etc.
- Driving = Ride horses, drive cars, fly spaceships, etc.
- Electronics = Hack into a terminal, fix a car, etc.
