# Simpler Things RPG Extras - Game Master Reference Sheet

This is a collection of useful examples.

## Quick Start

**First Time**

- The Game Master (GM) decides the genre, time, and setting for a game.
- Player Characters (PCs) use a Character Sheet and fill it out by following the Characters Creation guide.

**Every Session**

- (Optional) Each PC rolls `1d2` to determine if they start with a Good (1) or Bad (2) Omen.
- PCs can interact with anything in the game based off of their Skills and the related Traits. This is called an Action.
    - The GM and PC must agree on what Skill can be used for the situation.
    - The GM determines the Difficulty of a Skill Check based on the situation.
    - (Optional) Omens = Can be used once per game session.
        - Good = A PC can add an additional six-sided die to the Action dice pool.
        - Bad = The GM can increase the Difficulty of the Skill Check by 4 (up to a maximum of 12).
    - If the PC has an Expertise in a Skill, they can roll one extra six-sided die for the Skill Check.
- The GM determines the outcome of an Action based on the results of the Skill Check.
    - Positive or Negative Side Effect = A Positive, Neutral, or Negative Side Effect (a related event) happens as a result of the Action. This is determined by the GM. A Neutral Side Effect normally means nothing happens besides the Action the character was trying to do.
    - Epic Event
        - Good = Occurs if the PC rolls a result of 12 from their Skill Check. The Action is so perfectly executed that something amazing happens. The PC narrates what happens.
            - If this is for a Weapons related Action, the damage will be doubled.
        - Bad = Occurs if (1) a 1 is rolled on any die that is part of a Skill Check and (2) a 1 is also rolled on a Side Effect die. The Action is executed so awfully that something tragic happens. The GM narrates what happens.
- Combat
    - Everyone rolls `1d12` for their Turn Order and then adds their own Awareness level. The characters with the highest number goes first.
        - `1d12 + AWARENESS`
    - For a Weapons Action to work, a character must pass the Weapons (near or far) Skill Check based on the Difficulty of the Weapon.
        - If the Action succeeds, the character rolls `DIFFICULTY x d4` for damage.
            - If the Weapon is Vehicle sized, multiply the damage result by 10 to get the total damage.
- Magic
    - Works the same as any normal Skill check except it requires that a character has an Expertise in Magic to use it at all.

## Loot Table

This is a reference for the GM to determine what random items may be found when characters search through a room, storage container, pocket, etc.

Roll 1d20 and then give the character who is searching the loot the item(s) they found based on the result.
